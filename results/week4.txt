// Sometimes when I was a kid my parents would put on some music and we‚Äôd all dance around in the living room, and this is the song I always wanted to play. Somewhere there‚Äôs audio of me trying to sing along despite not knowing most of the words.

// I‚Äôd been listening to angsty 2000's rock since I was in Venezuela when I was 8, but I was introduced to this song by a presentation my dad did on the history of rock. On a segment about non-uk/us bands he highlighted the Milan based group, and played this song. He did some of these presentations once we had gotten to Costa Rica to cement some of the initial friends we had made after moving.
