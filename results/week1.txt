// Sampled in 28 songs and covered 35 times, this original version by Ann Peebles is still the best.

// Oof how do you come back from a 10 year hiatus dealing with health problems? Invaincu (undefeated) opens ‚ÄúMultitude‚Äù as this battle cry agains an anthropomorphized Malaria, setting stage for one of my favorite albums of the last few years. The background tune, the backing vocals, the intensity of the singing‚Ä¶shivers, I swear. Also, it leads straight into Sant√© (cheers) in the album, which is up there for my favorite song
