// Picture the retro rainbow roads, the one with the faces of characters drawn with multicolored stars across the dark sky. For once, this race isn’t about speed, but a celebration of the game wrapping up- grandiose, nostalgic, suave…

* That wrapping up piece - I think that this song does hit the rainbow road idea well, but it’s another great example of a recap song at the end of a series of races where it highlights key moments.

// This recording of domino line is a masterpiece; one of the greatest jazz fusion tracks of all time imo. I think it gives drift-heavy course through fields and tunnels with broad, sweeping turns, just like Yoshi circuit.

* I mean hands down gives Mariokart throughout the whole song, and is a bop. Great choice! It keeps going and it keeps delivering too, long song and unique the whole way through. A little lull at the halfway mark though. I could see this song being in neo bowser city as well, potentially, for the jazz piece. Extremely strong finish to the song

* 8-bit at the start so maybe a track that aligns with that? Good song and vibed with the lyrics. In certain places it almost gives DK vibes with the rhythm and instrumentals. Hard to pin the track other than that

* Ooooh! I was trying to think of what this gave, and it’s totally the Wii Mariokart music that plays after you finish a circuit and it’s doing a recap/review of the highlights of what happened. That or Electrodome in Mariokart 8.
