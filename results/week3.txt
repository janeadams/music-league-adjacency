// Ryan Reynolds, Taika Waititi, video games, AI, a love story, and probably some sort of moral argument about free will and developer responsibilities. What more could you ask for in a movie? The original Mariah Carey version of this song is central to Free Guy, except for one scene. This uses a new version that I love. Here's the clip:

Last of us: Season 1, Episode 7

(Spoilers if you haven‚Äôt seen this show) Legitimately missed the song on the first watch due to knowing what was coming sometime that night

https://youtu.be/mWErfaJjfE4?si=vXjAgUb8xPPKnWTD
Family guy: Season 4, Episode 9

The first time I saw this song on tv/movie - the gag was really funny and I definitely appreciated seeing the pop culture reference
