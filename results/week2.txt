// This song was originally the first song of the extended version songs of Pure Heroine, which no longer exists on Spotify in its full form, but all the songs exist through either weird singles like this one or an EP. Other major contenders for me for this for Lorde included Sober II (Melodrama) off Melodrama and Secrets from a Girl (Who‚Äôs Seen it All) off Solar Power, which I both really enjoy but this was the ~deeper cut~ because of the extended edition getting removed

// This song led me to read the "Early Life" section of her Wikipedia, and ever since, I've been able to hear a lot of her early life experiences in her music, even the bigger pop hits.

* So I‚Äôve known this song for ages, which is wild because I know very little Halsey (not sure if I‚Äôve heard the billion-listen song on that album in any way I could recognize before), but this one found its way to me somehow and I‚Äôve always really liked it. It‚Äôs literally the only Halsey song I have liked on Spotify.
